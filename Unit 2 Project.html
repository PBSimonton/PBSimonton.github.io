<h2> Preface </h3>

  <p>Once upon a time, long, long ago, in a realm called the Midwestern United
States—specifically the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, a group of friends
gathered together to forever alter the
history of gaming.</p>

<p>It wasn’t their intent to do so. They were
tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic,
monsters, and adventure. They wanted to play in those
worlds, rather than observe them. They went on
to invent Dungeons & Dragons.</p>

<h2> Using This Book</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Part 1
    <p>It is about creating a character, providing the
rules and guidance you need to make the character
you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the
various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and
other customization options that you can choose from.</p>
  <li> Part 2
    <p>It details the rules of how to play the game,
beyond the basics described in this introduction</p></li>
  <li> Part 3
    <p>It is all about magic. It covers the nature of m agic
in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the
huge variety o f spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>
</ul>

<h2> How To Play </h2>

<ol>
  <li>The DM describes the environment. The DM
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s
around them.
  <li>The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
“We’ll take the east door,” for example.
  <li>The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’
actions. Describing the results often leads to another
decision point.
